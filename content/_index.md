Welcome to the website of the NWERC 2023!

The Northwestern Europe Regional Contest (NWERC) is a contest in which teams from universities all over the Northwestern part of Europe are served a series of algorithmic problems. The goal of each team is to solve as many problems as possible within the 5 hour time limit. Potential solutions are submitted and corrected by an automated judging system. The team that solves the most problems at the end of the contest qualifies for the ICPC World Finals.

The 2023 edition of the Northwestern European Regional Contest (NWERC) will be held in late November or early December 2023. The contest will be held on the campus of the Delft University of Technology.
