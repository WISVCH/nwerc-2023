# Sleeping at TU Delft Campus

We provide 150 sleeping places for free at the TU Delft Campus in a sport hall. This requires you to bring your own sleeping
mats/bags and breakfast. You will be able to shower on the site. Entry to the sleeping hall is possible on the following dates:

* Friday night to Saturday morning: from 00:00 until 07:00
* Saturday night to Sunday morning: from 22:00 until 07:00

Note that the sports halls will be used during the day, so you will need to clear away your sleeping bags before 07:00 on both days.

We have room for 100 people, based on first come, first served. Registration for the X sleeping places will open closer to the contest.

All the above information is subject to change.
