The 2023 ICPC Northwestern Europe Regional Contest will take place this weekend, and we hope that you and your team are
prepared for this great event.
Please check for the latest [system information](/systems/) and the [schedule](/schedule).

We want to remind you of the following:

* The contest machines will be laptops, we do not provide you with an external keyboard. It is allowed to bring your own
  keyboard (only one per team, only simple USB keyboards allowed). An external mouse will be provided, and it is not
  allowed to replace it. Please hand in your keyboard at the registration desk and label the keyboard clearly with your
  university, team name, and team number.
* During the contest, you are only allowed to use your Team Reference Document (TRD) as reference material. You may
  bring three identical copies of the document per team, clearly marked with the university and team name. For
  specifications on the TRD, please check the [rules page](/rules/). Your TRD should be handed in at registration. It is
  not
  possible to print the TRD at the contest site.
* This year there will be no water bottle in the goody bag. We advise you to bring your own refillable water bottle. The
  water bottles can be filled at the taps in the toilets. The water from Dutch water taps can be drunk safely.
* People using the sleeping accommodations on campus can report at the [X building](https://map.tudelftcampus.nl/poi/x/)
  on Friday night at 23:00 and Saturday at 22:00. It is still possible to register for sleeping spots [here](https://forms.gle/c9qByf4SNYbWKop99).

We have made a special map for this contest with areas of interest in Delft. You can take a look at it
[here](https://wisv.ch/map). If you and/or your team want to register on-site on Saturday morning, please contact us if
you
haven't done so already.
