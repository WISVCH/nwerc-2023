## Contest Materials
We follow the World Finals’ Rules, so a team is allowed to bring 3 copies of their Team Reference document, but not allowed
to bring any additional reference materials such as books, program listings and notes! You may not bring any electronic device
or machine-readable media (this includes but is not limited to cell phones, **watches**, digital cameras, and mp3 players). You may bring
pens or pencils, but not paper (these will be provided). Winter coats, bags, etc. should not be brought to the contest floor.

Each contestant may bring a copy of a Team Reference Document. This document may contain up to 25 pages of reference materials,
single-sided, letter or A4 size, with pages numbered in the upper right-hand corner and your university name printed in the upper
left-hand corner. Text and illustrations must be readable by a person with correctable eyesight without magnification from a
distance of ½ meter. It may include handwritten comments and corrections on the fronts of pages only. The document should be
in some type of notebook or folder with the name of your institution on the front.

Each team member may bring one printed, unannotated natural language dictionary. You may bring mascots such as stuffed
toy animals or party hats (provided they do not violate any of the above constraints). If there is some other item your
team needs at the contest, please contact the Head of Jury.

Teams are allowed to bring one keyboard to replace the keyboard provided by the notebook. Note that keyboards with pre-programmed
macro keys are not allowed. Wireless keyboards are also not allowed. A mouse will be provided and may not be replaced by the team. 

Keyboard and Team Reference Documents should be handed in at the registration. Mascots, pens and the like can be brought during the test session and don't have to be handed in during registration.
