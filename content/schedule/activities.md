## NWERC activities
The following excursions are available for the 25th of November. There are limited capacities for each activity, so **full = full**. Registration is possible via the Google Form sent in your e-mail.

The activities will happen in two rounds.
- In the first round, we are excited to announce two inspiring company talks by our sponsors Huawei and JetBrains.
- In the second round, you can choose between various relaxing activities in Delft. We will cover the activity fee for the canal cruise, church visit, and beer tasting. Any other expenses made during this evening are for your own.


### In the second round, the following options are available (you can choose only one):

---

- Canal Cruise

You will get a boat tour through the Delft canals. Note that the starting time of the activity is the time your boat will leave. There are two rounds; one boat leaves at 16:15 and the other at 17:15. [Google Maps link to where the boat leaves](https://goo.gl/maps/BAkMNtkGcvJneWdR6).

You will visit the local Delft brewery 'de Koperen Kat', or, in English, 'the Copper Cat' [(Google Maps link)](https://goo.gl/maps/eXBfGVkCqJzyyMmK9), and you will get to sample a few different beers they make there.
